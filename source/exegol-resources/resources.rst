Resources
=========

.. _exegol-resources:

Exegol's "offline resources" are a neat choice of standalone tools and scripts that are often used during penetration tests,
CTFs and red-teams.
While many penetration testers download those resources again every time they need them, Exegol users don't have to.
Everything is managed by the wrapper and they are shared with every container by default (at ``/opt/resources``).

    The list featured here is automatically generated. Exegol features CI/CD pipelines that build the images, update the resources, etc.
    When a change is made on the Exegol-resources repository, it's reflected here, in the list.
