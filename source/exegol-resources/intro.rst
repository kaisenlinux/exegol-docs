.. _exegol-resources:

Exegol's "offline resources" are a neat choice of standalone tools and scripts that are often used during penetration tests,
CTFs and red-teams, like LinPEAS, WinPEAS, LinEnum, PrivescCheck, SysinternalsSuite, mimikatz, Rubeus, PowerSploit and many more.
Exegol users don't have to download those resources again every time they're needed anymore.
Everything is managed by the wrapper and they are shared with every container (at ``/opt/resources``).
