:code:`update` action
=====================

The update process
==================

The exegol wrapper has an ``update`` action dedicated to updating the different modules (wrapper, resources, etc.) of the project as well as the (docker) Exegol images.

.. _Modules-updates:

Modules updates
---------------

This action make sure the local copies of the following repositories are up to date:

* `Exegol <https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol>`_ (wrapper code). If the wrapper has been installed with Pip, it will not be able to self-update, updating the package through Pip will be required (e.g. ``python3 -m pip install --upgrade exegol``).
* `Exegol-images <https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol-images>`_ (docker building files)
* `Exegol-resources <https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol-resources>`_ (offline resources, :ref:`exegol-resources<exegol-resources>`). This module is optional, and users can choose to install/update it at any time.

.. tip::
    When running ``exegol update -v``, the user will be able to choose from what branch them module should be synchronized with, allowing to switch easily between release and dev versions.

.. _Images-updates:

Images updates
--------------

Once the local code base is updated, the wrapper compares the installed Exegol images with those offered on the Dockerhub registry. If no parameters have been provided at command-line, an interactive selection will be possible to choose the images to update (if updates are available).

.. hint::
    Older versions of images will be automatically deleted if they are no longer used by any container and if a newer version of the same image is installed.
    This automatic deletion behavior is a default configuration that can be modified in the :ref:`configuration file<exegol_configuration>` if needed, but it's advised not to change it as disk space is not unlimited and Exegol image can take up to 30GB.

The options of the ``update`` action are the following.
